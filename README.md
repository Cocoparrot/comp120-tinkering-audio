Contract 1: Generating Sound Effects/ Sam Hendrickx

To test the program just run the unity program and use wasd to walk around in the scene.

For this contract I was tasked to make Sound effects by code. 
The one currently implemented is a walking sound for the character.
This is done by getting one footstep sample and whenever the character moves it will play a variant of said sound.
To create different sounds I just manipulate the volume and pitch.

I am currently still working on a pickup sound. Meaning that when the character moves over an object that is collectible a sound will play.
I also want to try and get a level up sound. But getting good sounding clips made with code alone is challenging.
